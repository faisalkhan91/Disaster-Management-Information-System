In this thesis, I designed and implemented a disaster management platform which collects data from social media platform like twitter in real time using stream listener and stores the information in MongoDB, a NoSQL database, which is used to parsed the tweets. Hadoop map and reduce was used to extract related and meaningful data from the tweets which can be used directly using the provided API as well as have various applications using Machine Learning algorithms for modelling the various disaster scenarios. The data extracted was used to provide information about the resources available during a disaster like shelter capacity, food provisions and safe zones.
